Description: Agreement of continuously scaled measurements made by two techniques, devices or methods is usually evaluated by the well-established Bland-Altman analysis or plot. COAT embeds the latter in the framework of recursive partitioning to explore heterogeneous method agreement in dependence of covariates. COAT can also be used to perform a two-sample Bland-Altman test for differences in method agreement.
